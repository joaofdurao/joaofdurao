# 👋 Hello! Welcome to my Github profile.
### "Creativity and technical skill go hand in hand!"

✌️ My name is João Felipe Durão, and I am currently in the 5th semester of Software Engineering at Faculdade Damas - FADIC, 
focusing on back-end development and process automation. My goal is to apply the knowledge I have acquired to transform ideas 
into software and become a support and reference for my colleagues.
